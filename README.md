# Drones
The goal is to build a simulation game where drones are built, tasked and managed by the player.  Starting with a set amount of resources, the player builds drones, creates Tasks for them to complete (sometimes indefinitely in the form of Jobs). 
**Game genre and themes includes sandbox simulation, base-building, exploration, attack/defense(?), technology research, idle play.**

New facilities can be established to expand operations, to spread the hive and ensure longevity. Technologies can researched and honed to provide new capabilities or lower costs of current operations.

Manufacturing shall be simplified so that it does not need to be realistic (no complex 'recipe' trees) and more flexible.  Think of 4D games where a handful of resources are combined or required in various amounts to complete tasks. The goal here is expandability and flexibility, so that all resources are valuable, not just a key few. These resources might be abstracted and non-realistic names, to diverge from any criticism of "realistic" requirements and adherence to real-world chemistry and manufacturing. 

Player begins with a single starting source Facility on an asteroid in a field, starting resource pools, starting technology capabilities.  Those starting resources should help them begin their path on expansion.  Differing difficulties will influence starting resources.  Gathering the resources, the player can either build things, or find a way to market those items.

In the area there will be multiple targets for exploration, survey and developing operational annex facilities.  The goal is to expand the hive, establish longevity and fend off possible future rival drone colony attacks.

## Story background

Humans expanded and left earth, exploring the galaxy.

In one remote system, they found a planet torn apart by the gravitational field of a larger gas giant, turning the planet into a ring system rich in materials and elements.

An effort was made, using drones, to start mining that ring system, but something happened to the human settlers that erased them from the system.

Game picks up in the future, as the 'hive' or 'colony' or 'initial settlement' comes out of the umbra of the planet to be exposed to the star's light.  This melts ice that covered solar panels, charging the last remaining drone(s), waking them up.  This is where the player starts, with bare minimum supplies, infrastructure, and resources.

## Icon Production
https://cloudconvert.com provides a way to convert png files to icns, and allows for all OSes (.icns for Mac, .ico for Windows, Linux uses png already, all at 256x256px).  A single high-res (1024px) png image is all that is required to generate all the icon files that the app will need.

## Soundtrack
The game background soundtrack will be entirely by Stellardrone, with heavy documentation and links to his work on SoundCloud.  Players can of course turn off background music.
